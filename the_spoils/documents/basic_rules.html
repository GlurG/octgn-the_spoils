	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		This is a brief introduction to the flow of the game. If you just want
		to jump right in use this guide. For a more in-depth introduction we
		encourage you to read the advanced rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that this is, of course, a simplified version of the rules
		and not all rules will be covered here. Reading these rules, however,
		will allow you to get started with The Spoils and play using the precon
		decks.
	</p>

	<h2>Object of the game</h2>
	<p>
		Players strive to bring the opponent to 0 Influence Points (a standard
		game starts with each player having 25 Influence Points).
	</p>
	<p>
		The players try to outsmart and out-maneuver each other by playing
		cards from their hands; these cards can come in the form of Characters
		that can be used to attack the opponent, Locations and Items that also
		bring continuous advantages to the table, or Tactics that are one-time
		use cards that can be used to surprise the opponent and turn the tide
		of battle.
	</p>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<a name="c_faction_card"><h1>YOUR FACTION CARD</h1></a>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<div style="overflow: auto;">
	<img class="floatright" src="images/faction.png" alt="A faction card" />
	<p>
		Your faction starts the game in play. It provides essential abilities
		and affects how the game flows. You are only allowed to use one faction
		card.
	</p>
	<p>
		If damage is inflicted to your faction, it loses an equal amount of
		influence. Once your faction has 0 influence, you lose the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each faction holds certain special abilities that you can use
		during your turn or even on your opponent's turn.
	</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Important Terms</h2>
	<h3>Attaching and Unattaching Resources</h3>
	<ul class="list">
	<li>
		Whenever you have to pay a cost, you pay by taking the appropriate
		number of Resources (the numeric cost) and move them to your faction.
		This is called <strong>Attaching Resources</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
		At the beginning of your next turn, all of the attached Resources
		become ready for use again. This is called <strong>Detaching
		Resources</strong>.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Depleting and Restoring</h3>
	<ul class="list">
	<li>
		<strong>Depleting</strong> means to mark the card as being used
		(many players mark this by turning it sideways).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Restoring</strong> means the card becomes ready to use
		again (they become "undepleted"). This typically happens at the
		start of your turn, but there are ways to restore cards outside of
		this. To restore a card, undo whatever you did to deplete it.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<a name="c_card_types"><h1>CARD TYPES</h1></a>
	<!-- {{{ -->

	<div style="overflow: auto;">
	<img class="floatright" src="images/character.png" alt="A character card" />
	<h2>Character</h2>
	<p>
		Your characters can attack and block while they're in play.
		However, a character can't attack unless it started the
		turn in play under your control.
	</p>
	<p>
		A character's strength represents how much damage it can
		inflict in battle, while its speed defines when that damage
		is inflicted. Its life represents how much damage it takes
		to destroy it. If the damage a character receives in a
		single turn is ever equal to or greater than its life,
		destroy it immediately.
	</p>

	<h2>Item</h2>
	<p>
		Items stay in play and have an ongoing impact on the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some items can be attached to other cards in play. For example, an item
		with the keyword "Attach to Character" in its rules text means it
		should be attached to a character while it's in play.
	</p>

	<img class="floatleft" src="images/structure.png" alt="Location structure" />
	<h2>Location</h2>
	<p>
		Locations stay in play and have an ongoing impact on the game. However,
		they are vulnerable since they can be attacked by your opponent's
		characters.
	</p>
	<p>
		If a location receives damage, it gains damage counters. Unlike
		characters, the damage a location receives is not forgotten at the end
		of each turn. If the damage counters on a location are ever equal to or
		greater than its structure, destroy it immediately.
	</p>

	<h2>Tactic</h2>
	<p>
		Tactics have a one-time impact on the game. When a tactic resolves,
		follow its instructions and put it into your discard pile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tactics are special because they can be played in response to your
		opponent's actions, even if it isn't your turn. There are also special
		times during battles when you can play tactics.
	</p>
	</div>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<a name="c_resources"><h1>RESOURCES</h1></a>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		You use resources to pay for your cards. The more resources you
		accumulate, the bigger and better things you can play.	
	</p>

	<h2>Staple Resources</h2>
	<p>
		Staple resources are the simplest kind of resource and your deck is
		usually full of them. Each trade has its own staple resource type.
		Arcanist uses Obsession, Banker uses Greed, Gearsmith uses Elitism,
		Rogue uses Deception, and Warlord uses Rage.
	</p>

	<h2>Resource Icons & Threshold</h2>
	<p>
		Every staple resource card provides you with a distinct resource icon.
		These icons appear prominently on the resource and correspond to the
		threshold icons in the upper left corner of your other cards.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can't play a card until you've met its threshold. For example, if a
		card has a threshold of 2 Rage icons, you can't play it until you
		control at least 2 Rage resource cards. But once you control those
		resources, you can play any number of cards with a threshold of 2 Rage
		icons.
	</p>

	<h2>Face-Down Resources</h2>
	<p>
		When a card lets you play a resource, you don't always need an actual
		resource card. You can instead put any card from your hand into play
		face-down. Face-down resources provide the Volition icon.
	</p>

	<!-- {{{ -->
	<h2>How to Start</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		Your faction card starts the game in play.
	</li>
	<li>
		Flip a coin or roll dice to decide who goes first.
	</li>
	<li>
		Find the starting resources line on your faction. Search your deck for
		the appropriate resources and put them into play. If your
		pre-constructed deck has two kinds of staple resources, make sure you
		start with one of each.
	</li>
	<li>
		Find the starting draw line on your faction. Draw the appropriate
		number of cards.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may choose any number of cards in your hand and put them on the
		bottom of your deck in any order. Then, draw the same number of cards
		to replace the old ones. This is called a mulligan and it can be done
		before the game starts and only once.
	</li>
	<li>
		The game starts.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>What happens each turn</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<h3>Start of turn:</h3>
	<ul class="list">
	<li>
		<strong>Restore Rule:</strong> On each of your turns, all of your cards
		become ready again (Resources become unattached and all of your
		non-resource cards restore).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Develop Rule:</strong> On each of your turns you must decide
		whether to draw a card from your deck or to play a Resource (you cannot
		do both).
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The turn:</h3>
	<p>
		During your turn you may do as many things as you want as many times as
		you like and in any order you want, as long as you can satisfy all
		costs. Therefore, you may:
	</p>
	<ul class="list">
	<li>
		Use faction abilites multiple times, such as drawing extra cards or
		putting extra Resources into play (as described above)
	</li>
	<li>
		Attack as many times as you like
	</li>
	<li>
		Play cards from your hand
	</li>
	<li>
		Use abilites on cards that are in play (on the table)
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>End of turn:</h3>
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		When a player announces that he wants to end his turn the opponent gets
		a final chance to do something before the turn ends.
	</li>
	<li>
		All damage on Characters is reset to zero (damage on Characters is not
		carried over the next turn, but note that damage on Locations remain).
	</li>
	<li>
		Turn passes to the next player.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>How to Play a Card</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		Choose a card in your hand. Make sure your resource icons in play meet
		the card's threshold requirement. You don't have to use these specific
		Resources to pay the cost of the card, you just need to have them on
		the table somewhere.
	</li>
	<li>
		Satisfy all of the card's costs. This includes the numeric cost and any
		extra costs listed in its rules text. If you can't do this, you can't
		play the card.
	</li>
	<li>
		Wait for your opponent to respond with a tactic card or ability.
	</li>
	<li>
		The card resolves. If it's a character, item, or location put it into
		play. If it's a tactic, follow its instructions and put it into your
		discard pile.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>Abilities</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		Many cards have abilities in their rules text. Every ability has a
		center-justified name and a clearly labeled cost and effect section.
		For example:
	</p>
	<img style="display: block; width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
		src="images/ability.png" alt="A example ability" />
	
	<p>
		Some abilities even have threshold icons next to the name. You can't
		use an ability unless you've met its threshold and can satisfy all its
		costs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like tactics, abilities can be used in response to your opponent's
		actions even if it isn't your turn. There are also special times during
		battles when you can use abilities.
	</p>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>How to Use an Ability</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		Pick an ability you control. If the ability has a threshold, make sure
		your resource icons in play meet it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Satisfy all of the ability's costs, listed in its cost section. If you
		can't do this, you can't use the ability.
	</li>
	<li>
		Wait for your opponent to respond with a tactic card or their own
		ability.
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability resolves. Follow the instructions in the ability's effect
		section.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>Responding to Your Opponent</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		You get a chance to respond every time your opponent plays a card, uses
		an ability or ends their turn. If you choose to respond, you can play
		tactics and use abilities. All your responses resolve before your
		opponent's action happens.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that even responses can be responded to. A series of
		responses can go back and forth between players any number of times.
		Just remember that the last response made always resolves first.
	</p>
	<!-- }}} -->
	<!-- }}} -->

	<a name="c_battles"><h1>BATTLES</h1></a>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<h2>How to Attack</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		You win the game by attacking your opponent's faction. Characters can
		act alone or join together in battle parties. The way you combine your
		characters can drastically affect a battle's outcome. Since you can
		attack as many times as you want each turn, you have lots of battle
		options. To attack, follow these steps:
	</p>
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		Announce that you want to attack. By default, you are attacking your
		opponent's faction but you can choose to target one of their locations
		instead.
	</li>
	<li>
		Choose one or more characters you control that are not depleted to form
		the attacking party. Then, deplete the attacking characters. Remember,
		a character can't attack unless it started the turn in play under your
		control.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once the attacking party is formed, you can play tactics and use
		abilities. Then, your opponent can do the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		Your opponent may choose one or more characters they control that are
		not depleted to form the blocking party.
	</li>
	<li>
		Resolve the battle.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<!-- }}} -->

	<h2>How to Resolve a Battle</h2>
	<!-- {{{ -->
	<p>
		Characters with the same speed inflict their damage at the same time,
		but each speed group is handled separately. Start with the highest
		speed characters and work your way down. For each speed group, follow
		these steps:
	</p>
	<ol class="numberlist">
	<li>
		Before damage is assigned, the attacking player can play tactics and
		use abilities. Then, the defending player can do the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		All attacking characters in this group assign damage equal to their
		strength to the blocking. This damage can be divided however their
		controller wants. If there are no blocking characters left, the
		attacking characters assign their damage to the target of the attack
		instead. The blocking party may then assign damage equal to their
		strength to the attacking party divided however their controller wants.
	</li>
	<li>
		The assigned damage is now locked in. It will be inflicted even if its
		source leaves play.
	</li>
	<li>
		Before damage is actually inflicted, the attacking player can play
		tactics and use abilities. Then, the defending player can do the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		All locked in damage is inflicted. Any characters destroyed by this
		damage leave play immediately, even if they haven't acted yet.
	</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Repeat these steps until you've handled every character. Afterwards,
		all surviving characters in both parties are depleted and the battle is
		over.

	<p>
	The player whose turn it is currently.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>All</h3>
	<p>
	If an effect says "all" it is referring to everything, even if you control
	it. For example, if a card says "inflict 2 damage to all characters" then
	it would inflict damage to your characters as well as your opponent's.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>Assign Damage</h3>
	<p>
	When you are resolving a battle, damage gets assigned before it is actually
	inflicted. This gives the players a chance to react to the damage with
	tactics and abilities. However, once damage has been assigned it will still
	be inflicted even if its source leaves play beforehand.
	</p>
	<p>
	If there is nothing left for a character to assign its battle damage to,
	the character doesn't do anything but it is still considered to have
	assigned its battle damage.

	<p>
	To attach one card to another, arrange the attaching card so it overlaps
	the target card. When you attach a card to something, it is simultaneously
	detached from anything else it is already attached to.
	</p>
	<p>
	An attaching card can only be attached to one target at a time. However,
	target cards can have any number of cards attached to them at once.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a target card leaves play, any cards attached to it leave play in the
	same way. This includes being destroyed, removed from the game, put into
	owner's hand, or shuffled into owner's deck.

	When you play a card with this keyword, you must pick a target card of the
	appropriate type as the first extra cost. When the attaching card resolves,
	it enters play attached to the target card.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the attaching card's target is no longer in play by the time it
	resolves, put it into its owner's discard pile instead of into play.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the attaching card is put into play by an effect that does not specify a
	target for it, you must pick a target card as the attaching card enters
	play.
	</p>

	If the target card stops being the appropriate type, destroy the attaching

	<p>
	If an effect says you "can" do something but another effect says you
	"cannot", the most recent effect always wins.
	</p>
	<p>
	There's a difference between saying you "can" do something and being
	instructed to "do" that thing. For example, if a card says "characters
	cannot be destroyed" then all "destroy a character" instructions have no

	trade. Some cards can have more than one type at the same time.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a card with the "character" type loses that type, it forgets all damage
	it received this turn and it is removed from any battle it is currently in.
	</p>
	<p>
	If an effect refers to a specific type, but the card it is trying to affect
	is no longer that type, then the card is not affected by that effect. For
	example, if an effect says "destroy the character" but the card it is
	trying to destroy is no longer a character, nothing happens.

	<div class="nobreak">
	<a name="conditional"><h3>Conditional</h3></a>
	<p>
	Conditionals use the word "while" followed by a condition to define an

	A keyword that summarizes how to handle cards that have special attacking
	and blocking rules.
	</p>
	<p>
	If all members of an attacking party have the covert keyword in their rules
	text, that party is considered a covert party. Only covert characters can
	block a covert party. Also, covert characters can't block regular parties.

	<h3>Form a Battle Party</h3>
	<p>
	When you form a battle party, each of the characters performs an "attack"
	or "block" action. Anything that triggers when a character attacks or
	blocks happens at this time. ("If this card attacks, your faction gains 2
	influence.")
	</p>
	<p>
	Once the party is formed, the characters are in a state of "attacking" or
	"blocking" which may activate certain effects on your cards. ("While this
	card is attacking, it gains 1 strength.")
	</p>
	<p>
	If a character is added to a party after it is originally formed, the
	character didn't technically perform the "attack" or "block" action so
	anything that would normally trigger doesn't. However, the character is
	still considered to be "attacking" or "blocking" so any effects that check
	for that are still active.

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>Free</h3>
	<p>
	If an effect lets you play a card for "free" then its cost number is

	If a card moves from one game area to another, any unresolved effects that
	were going to impact it in the old area "lose track" of it. For example, if

	The numeric cost of a card is usually equal to its cost number. If a card

	</p>
	<p>
	While a card is being played, its numeric cost is handled differently. You
	must calculate it by keeping a running total of cost additions, increases,
	and reductions.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you play a card, its running total starts as its cost number. Then,
	you satisfy its extra costs. If an extra cost says "pay" followed by a
	number, you don't pay it right away. Instead, you add that number to the
	running total.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once all the extra costs are satisfied, you then apply all cost increases
	to the running total in any order you want, followed by all cost reductions
	in any order you want. The overall total is the card's numeric cost while
	it's being played. Finally, you pay that amount.
	</p>
	<p>
	An ability's numeric cost is handled in the same way. But since abilities
	don't have an inherent cost number, any ability without a "pay" instruction
	in its cost section is considered to not have a numeric cost at all.

	have their own copy of a "Unique Beatrix" card in play at the same time.

	<div class="nobreak">
	<a name="variablenumbers"><h3>Variable Numbers</h3></a>
	<p>
	Cards with variables (X, Y, Z, etc.) fully explain how those variables are
	used in their rules text.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you are instructed to choose a number for a variable, you must choose a
	whole number (2 is fine, but not 3.5).
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>When</h3>
	<p>
	If a phrase begins with the word "when" then it is probably a trigger.
	("When this card enters play, draw a card.")
	</p>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>Whenever You Could Play a Tactic</h3>
	<p>
	Some cards include the rules text "you may play this card whenever you
	could play a tactic." Although you can play them at the same times, these
	cards are never considered to actually be tactics.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>While</h3>
	<p>
	If a phrase begins with the word "while" then it is probably a conditional.
	("While this card is attacking, it gains 2 strength.")
	</p>

	<div class="nobreak">
	<h3>You, Your</h3>
